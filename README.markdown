# basetta does dotfiles                 

I forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)' [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) 
that is solid base to start my own dotfiles repository 

## Installation

git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install

## Environment

I am using zsh on Mac os. More precisely, I installed [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
